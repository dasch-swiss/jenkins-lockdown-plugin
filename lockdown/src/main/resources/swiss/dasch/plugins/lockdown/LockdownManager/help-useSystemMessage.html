  <p>
    Whether the Jenkins system message should be used to display the lockdown message.
    If set to false, the lockdown message won't be shown in the classic Jenkins UI.<br/>
    However, it remains accessible through the <code>/jenkins/lockdown/lockdownMessage</code> URL or, e.g., in Blue Ocean
    if the Lockdown (Blue Ocean) plugin is installed.<br/>
    The system message will only be overwritten if it is empty or has been set by the Lockdown plugin. Custom system
    messages will never be overwritten.
